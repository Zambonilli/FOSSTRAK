	<!-- CompactionMethodList.xsd specifies an enumerated list of supported compaction methods (used as the value of the compaction attribute of the field element within the binary level only) 
		 Permitted values include 32-bit, 16-bit, 8-bit, 7-bit, 6-bit, 5-bit 
		 Uncompacted ASCII bytes are denoted as '8-bit' compaction
		 '7-bit' compaction refers to ASCII bytes that have been compacted to 7 bits by truncation of the most significant bit 
		 '6-bit' compaction refers to ASCII bytes that have been compacted to 7 bits by truncation of the two most significant bits.  It allows for encoding of uppercase alphanumeric and symbol characters within ASCII range 32-95 
		 '5-bit' compaction refers to ASCII bytes that have been compacted to 7 bits by truncation of the three most significant bits.  It allows for encoding of uppercase alphabetic characters and some symbol characters within ASCII range 64-95 
		 '16-bit' and '32-bit' values are not in use in any current TDT definition file but allow for future multi-byte representation of characters outside of the ASCII / ISO Latin character set if necessary in a future version of TDS / TDT.
		 In fields or rules where no compaction attribute is specified, the field is assumed to be treated as an unsigned positive integer and encoded/decoded accordingly.
